## üîç Accident Detection Implementation

### 1. Accelerometer-Based Detection
The system monitors sudden changes in acceleration to detect potential collisions:

```cpp
if (a.acceleration.x > 0.06) { 
    digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW); 
    delay(100);
    Serial.print("Accident detect on acceleration : "); 
    Serial.print(a.acceleration.x);                    
    digitalWrite(4, LOW);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW);  
    delay(100);
}
```

### 2. Gyroscope-Based Detection
The system detects unusual rotational movements that may indicate rollovers or impacts:

```cpp
if (g.gyro.y > 0.45) { 
    digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW); 
    delay(100);
    Serial.print("Accident detect on gyro  : "); 
    Serial.print(g.gyro.y);                    
    digitalWrite(4, LOW);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW);  
    delay(100);
}
```

### 3. Temperature Monitoring
The system monitors temperature spikes that could indicate fire or engine damage:

```cpp
if (temp.temperature > 45) { 
    digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW); 
    delay(100);
    Serial.print("temperature is HIGH   : "); 
    Serial.print(temp.temperature);                    
    digitalWrite(4, LOW);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW);  
    delay(100);
}
```
